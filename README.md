Embedded Gesture Access Control System using STM32F429I-DISC1: PlatformIO (03/2023-05/2023)

● Formalized a high-accuracy gesture recognition using DTW, microcontroller firmware to record and save hand
movement sequence using accelerometer/gyro sensor, and low-pass filter removing noise from sensor signals.
● Enhanced usability and accuracy by implementing a user interface with real-time feedback using LEDs and a LCD
display, including a reset function for re-recording key sequences.
